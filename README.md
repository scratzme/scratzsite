# scratzsite
my main scratz.me website
This is my personal blog/portfolio/resume to showcase my website abilities and document my travels and excursions.   
I am also creating this git repository to practice with git.
funny thing, I'm also creating my website to practice the skill I'll be showcasing to the public, which is being able to customize any website. 
By using the website as a template, I can make every image and all the text customizable.  
So I'm using git to be able to work on it from anywhere.

I invite anyone to check out this framework.  I'm trying to learn as much as possible.
