TO REARRANGE COUCH ADMIN PANEL LEFT LISTINGS, reorg 'couch_templates' table in sql or set the 'order' parameter in the template

These templates are a mix of custom routes (blog) and normal couch routes.  Custom routes will have "...routable='1'" in the template and K_IGNORE_CONTEXT in the parenthasis - COUCH::invoke(K_IGNORE_CONTEXT); 
smart_embed (explained below) and normal cms:embed will also be used.  Smart embed requires file naming convention.
These notes assume starting from the Celestino template.  All page names reference pages in this site download.

BLOG: 
Using Custom Routes means there are separate pages for each view.  Using 'smart embed' means there must be a 'blog-default' in a 'blog' directory as a snippet.  Every view besides 'page' is a list view, so each of those should be named with its respective listing (list-view, category-view, author-view, archive-view)   
	Using/creating dynamic folders will create the category for the category view.
	Adding authors to About page will create a dropdown list for the authors of the blog. (ie: cms:editable name="author" label="Choose Author" opt_values="<cms:pages masterpage="about.php" orderby="page_name" order="asc" ><cms:show k_page_title />=<cms:show k_page_name /> | </cms:pages>" type="dropdown"/ ) - this code creates a dropdown list when creating an author

the following are the raw Celestino pages and folders and how they convert to this site.	
PAGES:
	HOMEPAGE:
		index.html = index.php --> homepage
	RESUME:
		home-vii.html = resume-home.php --> resume home view. Add the testimonials page to bottom.
			pages-testimonials.html (no rename necessary- page will be deleted) --> testimonial home view (exerpts). gets added to bottom of resume home view as the listing (home view) for testimonials
			testimonials-erica.html = testimonial.php --> testimonial page view
		pages-about.html (need to copy it for later use) = resume.php--> resume page view itself with contact form at bottom.
		another-service.html (need to copy it for later use) = resume-highlight page view.  resume-highlights list view is a blank page that embeds into resume.php so it won't have any header or anything like that.

		section-short-codes-stick-posts.html (page will be deleted) and blog-detail.html = blog.php --> blog page view.  use video elelment to use videos in the blog part of the photo slideshow and emulate the 'thumbnail slider' at bottom of blog.php for additional photos. 
		sliders-thumbnails.html (page will be deleted) --> add the 'thumbnail slider' at bottom of blog.php.

PORTFOLIO:
has 3 different sections created. PORTFOLIO GALLERY, PORTFOLIO VIDEO, AND PORTFOLIO itself and PORTFOLIO CATEGORY (port_cat). In order to choose the correct images for the portfolio, the gallery must be created first and MUST BE THE EXACT SAME NAME/TITLE AS ITS ASSOCIATED PORTFOLIO'S NAME/TITLE (homepage links won't work unless it is).  The category also needs to be created before the portfolio itself.  The gallery folder will become a dropdown choice when creating the portfolio which will tie the images to the portfolio.  The category will be a checkbox.  When uploading videos there are choices for embedding to Youtube, Vimeo or uploading the mp4,webm, ogg file.  The choice of what portfolio the respective video goes to will be a checkbox section on the portfolio page itself
TO CREATE A PORTFOLIO make sure the category has been created and start in the PORTFOLIO GALLERY.  First, create the folder, then upload all the images to that folder.

The "opt_values" for the dynamic="opt_values" (opt_values="xxxxxx") need to reside in the SNIPPETS root. otherwise they don't read


BLOG:
Blogs need a gallery and an author.  The author comes from a dropdown listing of "about.php", so that should be filled out first.
Once the author has been created, refresh 'author.php' if the author doesn't show up in the dropdown box.


FOR better spam protection,  use this code instead of captcha:
<label class="required" for="human">Are you human? Is sky blue or green? (4 characters required) <em>* <cms:if k_error_human>Please answer the question</cms:if></em></label>
<cms:input type="text" required='1' validator='regex=/^blue$/i' class="input-text required-entry" id="human" name="human"/>

To use cms:smart_embed the file names use folders for page-head, header, nav, content, footer (etc.) and name the files inside the respective folders (views) home, list, archive, default (ex: blog-home, blog-archive, blog-list, blog-default ) and place them in the respective folders in the 'snippets' directory.


WHEN WIPING SITE TO START FRESH -  backup db just in case, then wipe out.  
Admin --> Addons --> Extended --> config.php:  erase what populates the templates [tpl]. If these aren't erased, there will be a loop created at the first login.  After the root index is registered and couch is installed and logged on, then register the templates in "users" directory. First register 'index.php' then add "users/index.php" to the config file. Re-register 'users/index.php'Log out and in and it should be where I can go into the original "users" open my name and click save w/out making changes, then go to the extended 'users' and see my name there.  
Next, register 'login.php'.  Once this is complete, fill in the login line of the config.php file. thenregister 'lost-Password.php' and fill in the config line with "users/lost-password.php".  Then register 'register.php and fill in the config file with "users/register.php".  If I log out of the admin panel, I should at this time see links for lost password and register.  I should be able to click them and they should take me to their respective screens.  Make sure I'm logged in and then register 'profile.php'.  I should see the form that shows my profile info.

do not style the login pages until all regular site pages have been registered and are working.
Now I can start to register the appropriate root, etc. pages.  To easily register the index, portfolio, about, and resume pages, erase the html, then regester, then undo the erase.  Otherwise there could be looping going on during registration.
